    <div><p>Hi, my name is Ben but I go by my nickname Street! This is my personal
    website for professional displays and business ventures. I am going to
    stream my progress whilst working on freelance web design/development.
    I also will give you a little more info about myself! Scroll down =D

     I am currently 26 and work in mobile device sales and troubleshooting
     for a major cellular carrier. I have an abundance of passions(hobbies,
    interests, talents, and etc) that I like to pursue! I love music and
    have some singing and guitar experience. When its cold out I like to
    snowboard, stay in and play games, sometimes hike, and always down to
    catch a movie or start a tv series! But in the warm sun I like to
    surf(when im out west), shoot hoops, hike, kayak, skateboard, go to parks,
    and basically anything my girlfriend would like to do as well!

     Speaking of my girlfriend; She's the best girl in the world, is extremely
     beautiful, works with younger kids with or without disabilities, is
     always up for an adventure, and will explore the whole world with me! She
     is my angel and helps me with anything and everything!

     As for my goals! I plan to create a lot of websites and software style
     products in the short and long term! I also want to prove myself as a
     musician whether on stage or in the studio. I would love to live in
     california again or colorado for the first time. Currently in my home
     city of Cincinnati though. Of which I am very thankful because I
     met my girlfriend visiting Lexington, KY for a concert!</p>
